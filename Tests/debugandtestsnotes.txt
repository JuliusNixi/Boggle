If make isn't used remember to compile (to debug) using the gcc flags:
-Wall -g -ggdb3

To compile all and start debugging:
cd ..
make
gdb ./paroliere_srv

To disable gdb signals stop:
handle SIGUSR1 noprint
handle SIGALRM noprint

To start the process, where all after run are the process' args:
run localhost 8080

On errors, for example a SIGSEGV, it's useful see the list of the functions called, you can use:
backtrace
or:
bt
or:
where

To enter in a called function, use:
select-frame n      With n the number of the frame obtained by the previous command.

To get frame's infos after selection:
info frame

To see all threads infos:
info threads

To switch (selecting) a thread:
thread n        With n the number of the desired thread, obtained by the previous command.

To see the content pointed by a pointer var:
x/s pointerstring   Print the string of a char* pointerstring.
x/d pointerint      Print the int pointed by int* pointerint.
To see all the possibilities take a look at https://visualgdb.com/gdbreference/commands/x

It's possible to print entire structs also using casting and the direct struct memory pointer value.
For example to see the mutex's data (also the current owner):
p *((pthread_mutex_t*) 0x7f37e8004da0)
Or to see the content of a ClientNode struct:
print *clientnode       With clientnode a struct ClientNode*.

To see current called function's infos:
info locals 
Also useful:
info args

To see the open processes (also the PID):
ps u

To suspend the process and return on gdb (for example in case of deadlock), from another shell, out of gdb:
kill -TRAP PID      With PID the process' ID, obtained by the previous commands.
or:
pkill -TRAP paroliere_srv  
To see why CTRL + C on GDB doesn't work also if this signal is not handled from our program:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5857300/gdb-ctrlc-doesnt-interrupt-process-as-it-usually-does-but-rather-terminates-t

To kill forcibly a process:
kill -9 PID     With PID the process' ID, obtained by the previous commands. 9 is SIGKILL, it's must be handled by the OS, not the process.

To execute the server, keep seeing the STDOUT AND STDERR, but also logging them in a file:
./paroliere_srv localhost 8080 2>&1 | tee outputserver.txt

On macOS I had to increase the limit of open files to run so many clients (in tests):
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73977844/too-many-open-files-during-rspec-tests-on-macos

I debugged mainly with gdb on the LABII shared machine.
That's because on macOS there's not gdb. 
There is lldb, but some of the previous commands are different, here is a translation of some of them.

On lldb to handle a signal:
proc handle -p true -s false -n false SIGUSR1       Where p stands for "PASS" to the process. s Stands for "STOP" the debugger. n Stands for "NOTIFY".

On lldb to see the list of the functions called, you can use:
backtrace

On lldb to select a frame, you can use:
frame select n      With n the number of the frame obtained by the previous command.

To search a word in all files:
grep -Rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e 'pattern'
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16956810/find-all-files-containing-a-specific-text-string-on-linux

To see (both macOS and Linux) ports used by a process (useful for debugging, i.e. discovering a specific client connected to the server by its used out port):
lsof -i -n -P | grep process_pid
