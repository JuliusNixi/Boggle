# Python tests
Since the difficulty of testing in C a project divided into client and server, most of the tests were done by simulating clients processes with Python. This is done in the "./pythontests.py" file. The tests are written in Python 3 and should work with all libraries installed by default without requiring any external resources. 

## Usage and execution
python3 ./pythontests.py SERVER_IP SERVER_PORT

## Logs subfolder
In the "./Logs" subfolder you will find the logs (commands sent and the STDOUT) of all the clients processes spwaned by the "./pythontests.py" file.
