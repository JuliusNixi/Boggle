# Docs folder
This folder contains all the (in italian) project's documentation.

## Assignment subfolder
In the "./Assignment/" subfolder there are the project's descriptors files given by the professors.

## Report subfolder
In the "./Report/" subfolder you will find the illustrative report of the project (coded by me) written by me. It was written in LaTeX. The final result is the "Relazione Progetto Esame Corso Laboratorio II - Giulio Nisi.pdf" file.
