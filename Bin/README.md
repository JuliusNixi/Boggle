# Bin folder
This folder contains the project's binaries, "boggle_server", "boggle_client" and "boggle_tests".  
These binaries files are also present in the project's root folder with the names respectively of "./paroliere_srv", "./paroliere_cl" and "./paroliere_tests" (italian files names).  
Do not execute these binaries (in this folder), instead, execute the ones in the root folder, since some absolute paths have been used.
This folder also contains the object files used to compile these binaries.

## Usage and execution
See "../README.md", the file in the project's root folder.
